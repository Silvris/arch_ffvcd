# Final Fantasy V Career Day

## What is Final Fantasy V Career Day? 

Final Fantasy V Career Day is a randomized version of FFV that abstracts progress in the game. The player starts with an 
airship, and has the ability to check many locations immediately. Cutscenes are largely removed from the game. The
player is given a WarpShard, which allows access to the different worlds of FFV. Depending on the settings chosen, 
worlds are unlocked at different checkpoints.

You can find [a wiki for FFVCD here](https://www.bigbridge.studio/cdwiki/doku.php). Note that this wiki is not 
specifically for multiworld, but will contain many pertinent details. 

## Game Progression

The goal of the game is to defeat Exdeath in World 3. In order to do that, there are a few critical key items:

- The Adamantite key item permits access to World 2 via the WarpShard
- The Anti-Barrier and Bracelet key items permit access to Exdeath's Castle in World 2
- Defeating Exdeath in World 2 unlocks access to World 3 via the WarpShard
- The Rift is immediately available in World 3. In order to progress to the end of the Rift,
4 tablets must be acquired. 
- After 4 Tablets are acquired, Exdeath can be fought in World 3.

There are many other key items. For example, one of the required Tablets may be placed in the Great Trench.
The Great Trench requires World 3 access, the Submarine Key to use the submarine function of the ship,
and the Trench Page to allow access to the dungeon.

Under standard settings, only bosses can award progression related checks for either the player's seed
or for other players' multiworlds. All other chests & events provide anything from helpful to filler rewards.

## Key Items

[Visit this FFVCD Wiki page for the list of key item descriptions](https://www.bigbridge.studio/cdwiki/doku.php?id=key_items)
The default setting for FFVCD in Archipelago is "World 1 (W1) lock", which means that the player is locked in
World 1 until Worlds 2 & 3 are unlocked.  

## Reward Placement

Besides the bosses mentioned above, all other locations for finding items are either chests or events. You can generate
a test seed and review all of these in the spoiler log. Each seed will generate the following and send across the multi-
world:

- All individual Job Crystals
- All individual magic spells (all types in the magic menu) 
- All Job abilities. Each ability is learned for each party member (e.g., finding Summon Lv3 adds it to everyone)
- All remaining items placed are for one of each item, ranging from regular items to weapons and armor

## Where is the settings page?

The settings page [can be found here](../player-settings).

## When does a player receive items?

Generally players will receive items as they are collected by other worlds. There are three places where items
arent't collected and temporarily paused:

- While in a menu (specifically when the screen is not dimmed after a transition)
- While in battle
- While on the title screen and not yet in a loaded game
